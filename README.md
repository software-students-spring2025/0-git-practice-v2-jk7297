# [Nvidia stock begins recovery after DeepSeek AI frenzy prompted near $600 billion loss](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-begins-recovery-after-deepseek-ai-frenzy-prompted-near-600-billion-loss-134240328.html)

This article by Laura Bratton highlights the recent buzz surrounding DeepSeek AI technology and its significant impact on Nvidia. Nvidia, which has been on a steady rise for a couple of years, has dominated the AI chip market, leaving competitors like Intel and Apple far behind. The company, which skyrocketed by 171.2% just last year, now seems to be losing its footing in 2025, facing a massive challenge with the development of the new AI, DeepSeek. DeepSeek's entry into the market caused Nvidia to experience its largest single-day drop, wiping nearly **$600 billion** off its market value (which is just crazy to me!). The fact that DeepSeek claims to have developed their cutting-edge technology with only $6 billion has everyone, including myself, asking “How?” 

However what's particularly interesting is the suggestion by some analysts that DeepSeek’s low-cost claims might not tell the full story. Analysts from JPMorgan and Citi pointed out that DeepSeek relied on Meta’s open-source Llama AI model through a process called “distillation,” so the $6 billion they cite likely doesn’t include all the associated costs. This makes me wonder if DeepSeek is deliberately framing its costs as a marketing strategy to position itself as a low-cost, high-quality competitor especially since their model performs on par with OpenAI’s so the cost is what might help them stand out and strategically challenge giants like Nvidia and OpenAI. Therefore, this article raises questions about the "true" production and labor costs of their technology, especially given how often Asian companies are spotlighted for poor labor conditions as a means of achieving lower production costs. Additionally, what makes me even more curious is Nvidia’s response as they didn’t outwardly express concern about such a huge loss and even called DeepSeek’s model “an excellent AI advancement,” which to me feels like an attempt to downplay any anxiety they might actually have.
